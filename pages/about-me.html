                                I am a Scrimba student currently enrolled in the Frontend
                                Developer Career Path Pro Plan. I am a retired Information
                                Systems developer. I have started this exciting new journey to
                                renew my skills and become a skilled frontend developer.

                                You are never too young or old to learn. I have never used a
                                learning journal before now. However, now that I have started
                                using this one, I find that maintaining a journal definitely has
                                its merits. Reviewing the work and any notes I made during the
                                day and then writing my thoughts down, clarifies and deepens my
                                understanding of the concepts and techniques I learned that day.

                                Scrimba likes to call it "develop your muscle memory" by
                                avoiding using copy/paste when you write your code. I have found
                                that this learning technique promotes the retention of what I
                                have learned in the module I'm working on. Understanding plus
                                retention creates confidence for me in design, coding and
                                deployment.

                            Scrimba's updated and improved cirriculum,including its use of AI,
                            provides a great learning advantage. I've also been utilising
                            Scrimba's discord channel.
